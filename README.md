# Autonomous Navigation using Wheel Odometry
This is a project that implements Single-Source-Shortest-Path finding - **A-Star** algorithm on **Differential Drive Robots** using **ROS** - (Robot Operating System). 

The differential drive robot that we have used is the **Turtle Bot 3 - Waffle Pi** from **ROBOTIS** that runs ROS - **NOETIC**.

The steps to setup and run the **Turtle Bot 3** are given on the official website of [ROBOTIS](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/).

Some pre-requisites to successfully implement this repository are:
- ROBOTIS Turtle Bot 3
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - focal fossa
+ ROS NOETIC 
- Python - 2.7 or above
