# Autonomous Navigation using Wheel Odometry
This is a project that implements Single Source Shortest Path finding algorithm - **A-Star** algorithm on **Differential Drive Robots**. 

The differential drive robot that we have used is the **Turtle Bot 3 - Waffle Pi** from **ROBOTIS**.

The steps to setup and run the **Turtle Bot 3** are given on the official website of [ROBOTIS](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/)
