# Autonomous Navigation 
This is a project that implements Single-Source-Shortest-Path finding - **A-Star** algorithm on **Differential Drive Robots** using **ROS** - (Robot Operating System) and **Wheel Odometry** developed by **Mohd Farhan Haroon** at **Integral University, Lucknow.**. 

This repository is the software implementation of another project under development - **Autonomous Ground Cleaning Robot**. That project will utilise this Autonomous Navigation repository and will be built completely in-house at the **Integral Robotics Lab**.

The differential drive robot that we have used is the **Turtle Bot 3 - Waffle Pi** from **ROBOTIS** that runs ROS - **NOETIC**.
The steps to setup and run the **Turtle Bot 3** are given on the [official website](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/) of ROBOTIS.

Pre-requisites:
* Differential Drive Robot that runs ROS NOETIC 
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - focal fossa
* ROS NOETIC on host PC
* Python - 2.7 or above
