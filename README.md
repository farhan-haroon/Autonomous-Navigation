/* Under Development */

This repository contains the python codes for developers using ROS for Path Planning of Ground Robots like the Turtle Bot 3.

It implements various path planning algorithms on saved map images of the environment by converting them into binary images (combination of 0s and 1s).

This repository is yet under development.

Good Luck!
